# field-mapper

Data Repository for OPEL's low cost magnetic field mapper. This repository contains data processing files and plotting scripts for field mapping. Files in this repository should be run after field mapping data is taken. The MATLAB script (.m) in the template scripts subdirectory contains all of the instructions needed to successfully perform data analysis, and the datasets repository has an example of a previous dataset (and supplementary files) from Fall 2024, used for the Field Mapping Scitech Paper.
